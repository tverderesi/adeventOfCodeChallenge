#Advent of Code 2022 - Day 10
This is my implementation for Day X of the Advent of Code 2016 challenge, written in Python.

##Problem Description
The problem for this day involves designing a replacement for a device's video system by analyzing the signal being sent by its CPU. The CPU has a single register, X, which starts with the value 1 and supports only two instructions: addx V (which takes two cycles to complete and adds the value V to the X register) and noop (which takes one cycle to complete and has no effect). The challenge requires us to determine the signal strength (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register) during specific cycles in the program's execution.

##Solution Approach
My approach to this problem involved parsing the program input file to obtain the instructions and their corresponding values. I then executed each instruction in order and kept track of the value of register X. Finally, I calculated the signal strength at the specified cycles by multiplying the cycle number by the current value of X.

##Results
My solution produces the correct signal strengths for the specified cycles in the program execution. The code runs efficiently and should be able to handle larger inputs as well.
